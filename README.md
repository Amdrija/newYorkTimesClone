# New York Times Clone

This page is a clone of New York Times article page: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0. It was made as an assignment from The Odin Project's curriculum, used to practice CSS and HTML. You can see it at this link: https://amdrija.github.io/newYorkTimesClone/.

There is also a bit of JavaScript running on this page, but it's only used to change the text decoration of a link when it was visited. Since browsers don't allow to change text-decoration proparty of a:visited, I used a script to be able to change the text-decoration of a link when it is clicked.
